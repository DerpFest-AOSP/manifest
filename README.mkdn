DerpFest
---------------


Getting Started
---------------

To get started with Android, you'll need to get familiar with [Source Control Tools](https://source.android.com/setup/develop).
To set up your build environment and sync DerpFest, please follow this guide: [Link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nathanchance/android-tools/main/guides/building_aosp.txt)

**To initialize your local repository using the AOSP/CAF based DerpFest source, use a command like this:**

```bash
repo init -u https://github.com/DerpFest-AOSP/manifest.git -b 14-420
```
**Sync up with this command:**
```bash
repo sync -c --force-sync --optimized-fetch --no-tags --no-clone-bundle --prune -j$(nproc --all)
```

Building the source

The source at DerpFest is well configured for building.

**Initiate the build with:**
```bash
. build/envsetup.sh
```
**Prepare your device with:**
```bash
lunch derp_$device-user
```
**Then fire it off with:**
